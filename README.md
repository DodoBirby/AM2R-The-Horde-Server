# Horde AM2R Server
The Horde is made with [UndertaleModTool](), which is why this source is not a Game Maker Studio repo.  
In order to use this: Use the aforementioned UndertaleModTool to open the data.win (`game.unx` / `game.ios`) from the Releases and its repacker scripts, along with [these](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/pull/685/files) scripts for importing Rooms/Objects.

Original readme can be found below.

Server icon made by ShirtyScarab554.

Runs on port 64198 by default but can be changed within the server.

The server will report whether it is running, the amount of clients connected, current progress, and a list of player names.
